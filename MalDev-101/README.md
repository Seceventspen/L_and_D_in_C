**MalDev learnings**

## `‚ö†Ô∏è` Intro

This repository was created to serve as an archive, along with documenting all of my attempts to learn C, C# and C++, with the objective being to be better at understand malware development.

_Note: For the most part, consider anything in this repo as **not OpSec safe** as thats not the initial focus of learning at the moment, though the plan is to progress my knowledge and then tweak the code in an interative fashion to become more **OpSec safe**_

## `üõë` Disclaimer

Obviously, the content in this repository is **explicitly for educational purposes / my own self learning and development**. You'll find it hard to execute any of the code in a patched and mature environment without getting detected. Regardless, I do not consent to nor condone the use of these programs for any malicious activities. You have been warned!!
