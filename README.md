Binary Review and Exploitation: Learning and Development Training/Challenges

## `‚ö†Ô∏è` Intro

This repository was created to serve as an archive, along with documenting all of my attempts to learn C, C# and C++. The objective being to better understand malware development. I'm not brand new to all of this side of things, as in coding etc.; however, The end goeal is to get a better foundational understanding of C, which in turn will aid in understanding malware and writing code to be used on adversarial / Red Team engagements.

As such, I'll be starting out start from the absolute beginning, primarily learning C and its derivatives properly _(fingers crossed!)_ and seeing how far we can get.
