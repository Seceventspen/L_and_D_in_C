## `‚ö†Ô∏è` Intro

This repository was created to serve as an archive, along with documenting all of my attempts to learn C, C# and C++. The objective being to better understand malware development. I'm brand new to all of this side of things, as such, I'll be starting out start from the absolute beginning, ideally learning C and its derivatives properly _(fingers crossed!)_ and seeing how far we can get.
