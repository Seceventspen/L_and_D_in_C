**Message Box README**

---

**Project Overview:** The `msgBox.c` program is a basic attempt in C to create a Windows pop-up message box using the Win32 API. It demonstrates the usage of the `MessageBoxW` function to display a message box with specified text, title, and icon.

**Functions and Windows API Calls Used:**

1. **MessageBoxW:**
    - Purpose: Displays a modal dialog box that contains a system icon, a set of buttons, and a brief application-specific message.
    - Usage: Displays a message box with specified parameters, including the message text, title, icon, and buttons.
    - Parameters:
        - `hWnd`: Handle to the owner window of the message box. NULL for no owner window.
        - `lpText`: Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the message to be displayed.
        - `lpCaption`: Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the dialog box title.
        - `uType`: Specifies the contents and behavior of the message box.
    - On-Screen: Upon execution, a message box will be displayed with the specified message, title, icon (information), and buttons (Yes, No, Cancel).

**Expected Outcome:** Upon execution, the program displays a message box with the text "1337 PeePee PoopyPants!", the title "HaxX0rs", an information icon, and three buttons: Yes, No, and Cancel. The message box is modal, meaning it must be closed before the user can interact with the parent window.

**Usage:**

1. Compile the code using a C compiler compatible with the target system.
2. Execute the compiled program.
3. Observe the appearance of the message box on the screen.
4. Interact with the message box by clicking the available buttons: Yes, No, or Cancel.

**Note:** The `MessageBoxW` function is a convenient way to display messages and gather user input in Windows applications. Adjust the parameters passed to `MessageBoxW` to customize the appearance and behavior of the message box as needed.
