**easyCalc README**

---

**Project Overview:** The `easyCalc.cpp` program is a basic attempt in C++ to create a simple calculator application in the terminal. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by interacting with a menu-based interface.

**Functions:**

1. **numGame1():**
    
    - Purpose: Performs addition of two numbers.
    - Usage: Prompts the user to input two numbers, calculates their sum, and displays the result.
    
2. **numGame2():**
    
    - Purpose: Performs subtraction of two numbers.
    - Usage: Prompts the user to input two numbers, calculates their difference, and displays the result.
    
3. **numGame3():**
    
    - Purpose: Performs multiplication of two numbers.
    - Usage: Prompts the user to input two numbers, calculates their product, and displays the result.
    
5. **numGame4():**
    
    - Purpose: Performs division of two numbers.
    - Usage: Prompts the user to input two numbers, calculates their quotient, and displays the result.
    
5. **menu():**
    
    - Purpose: Displays a menu for the user to choose an arithmetic operation or to quit the program.
    - Usage: Accepts user input to select an operation, then calls the corresponding arithmetic function.

**Expected Outcome:**

Upon execution, the program greets the user and presents a menu with options to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or to quit the program. After selecting an option, the user is prompted to input numbers based on the chosen operation, and the result is displayed in the terminal. The program continues to run until the user chooses to quit.

**Usage:**

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler compatible with the target system.
2. Execute the compiled program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform arithmetic operations or to quit the program.

**Note:** This calculator program is a simple example of basic arithmetic operations in C++. It is intended for learning purposes and may lack advanced features found in standard calculator applications.
