# L_and_D_in_C
Basic Learning and Development with C Code

---

## `⚠️` Intro

This repository was created to serve as an archive, along with documenting all of my attempts to learn C, C# and C++. The objective for this particular repo is to get my head around the basics of C & its derivitives.

I'm not brand new to all of this side of things, I mean you can give me some source code, I can for the most part sometimes understand it; though normally only enough to know the gist of the program’s purpose, to then allow me to alter it to my desired need or purpose.

I know the common vulnerabilities that lead to buffer overflows; stack-based, format strings, etc., that said, I'll be going back to basics and starting out start from the absolute beginning, primarily learning C, with C# and C++ mixed in for good measure.
